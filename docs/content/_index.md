[Sample Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/) is an example Kubernetes controller in the Kubernetes project, with which you can learn a lot about how Kubernetes controller is implemented and how it works.

However, it is quite hard for newbies to start reading the source code. I tried to break down the complete code into step by step so anybody can create the example controller from scratch.

I hope this documentation will be helpful to open the door to the world of Kubernetes operator.
