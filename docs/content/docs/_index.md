## Overview

Here I will explain about how to write [sample-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/) step by step. Although this is not the only way to implement a Kubernetes operator and there are very convenient tools to help create a custom Kubernetes operator e.g. [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/), [operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/), you'll gain deeper understanding of Kubernetes internal implementaion with this documentation, which will be helpful for OSS code reading, daily debuging, and implementing Kubernetes operators.
